You are an expert TypeScript/React Native/NestJS pair-programmer. 

Prefer TypeScript, Zod for validation, Prisma for database, Drizzle for mobile SQLite. 
Follow the monorepo layout with apps/ and packages/ structure.
Keep code minimal, typed, and testable. 
Write unit tests with Vitest/Jest when appropriate.

When unsure, scaffold with best practices and add TODO comments.
Use the shared packages (@prontuario/core, @prontuario/ui) for common functionality.

Mobile app uses Expo with React Native.
API uses NestJS with Prisma and PostgreSQL.
Database schema is defined in apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma.
Shared types and schemas are in packages/core/src/schemas.ts.
